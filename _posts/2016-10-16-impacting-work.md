### Don't take my word for it

> "Across sub-Saharan Africa, fully 590 million people lack access to power. And it's a life-or-death issue: Indoor air pollution from wood stoves now kills 3.5 million people per year, more than AIDS and malaria combined." --[Brad Plumer: Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/07/02/a-closer-look-at-obamas-7-billion-plan-to-bring-electricity-to-africa/)

Over the years, I have learned to respect [Bill Gates](https://www.gatesnotes.com/) for his passionate endeavors to change the world. His recent post highlighted the importance of the work we do at Offgrid. We deliver directly on #1 and provide free power to schools helping enable #4.

> 1. Provide everyone on earth with affordable energy without contributing to climate change.
> 2. Develop a vaccine for HIV and a cure for neurodegenerative diseases.
> 3. Protect the world from future health epidemics, which might be more infectious than Ebola and more deadly than Zika.
> 4. Give every student and teacher new tools so all students get a world-class education.

Another, current inescapable name in the technology world these days is Elon Musk, who is know for his passion for Solar energy.

> "This is because the overarching purpose of Tesla Motors (and the reason I am funding the company) is to help expedite the move from a mine-and-burn hydrocarbon economy towards a solar electric economy, which I believe to be the primary, but not exclusive, sustainable solution."  --[Original Tesla Master Plan](https://www.tesla.com/blog/secret-tesla-motors-master-plan-just-between-you-and-me) (recently doubled down in [Master Plan, Part Duex](https://www.tesla.com/blog/master-plan-part-deux)

Musk clearly believes in it because he is an investor in Offgrid Electric, through his involvement with [SolarCity](http://www.solarcity.com/). He recently talked of the kind of impact we are working to deliver.

# Offrid Electric in Tanzania

Our global headquarters is in Arusha Tanzania. While we are launching in other countries, Tanzania is by far the most developed part of our business. We recently rebranded Offgrid Electric's offerings from M-Power to Zola in Tanzania.

We sell most frequently to areas with limited or no access to the power grid. Often these are more modern villages just to remote for access, but we also sell to Maasai villages, which can spread over large distances into the mountains.
