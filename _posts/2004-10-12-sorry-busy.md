Sorry there has been no updates and no new code posted for awhile. In fact comments were broken for the last couple months. Well I have fixed the comments and will slowly be getting back into some of the coding stuff. I have been busy with my job hunt, which seems to be going pretty well, but I dont want to jinx it. 

I have been doing some interesting stuff in my AI course and learning alot, we have been working with Agents and Probablistic Inference... We are now doing Utility funtions and feedback learning systems, which is pretty cool. I wish i knew more about knowlege representation. Since coding up the problems takes me so long in part because i dont know how to represent all of the data for the problems. Oh well all is going well and I am learning, and I guess that is what that matters. The concepts I get and the coding I can figure out with time.
