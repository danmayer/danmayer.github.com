This is going to be a research blog kept by Dan Mayer to show his progress on his computer science research into machine learning.

I will be setting up a collection of all the work and research that I have done on machine learning. I am working on a project for the L3D labs at the University of Colorado. I am working specifically with text categorization, currently focused on using LSA and SVM to categorize. I will post all the links, projects, examples, and resources that I have used and learned from during my progress on this project.

This is documenting the work on my project <a href="http://clever.cs.colorado.edu:8080/newsShaker/jsp/index.jsp">News Shaker</a>, which will be similiar to <a href="http://news.google.com/">google news</a>. It uses a web spider and text categorization to organize the data into particular categories. The categories I am currently working with are special education related. The topics of the categories were choosen so that this project would become a sub project of <a href="http://www.web2gether.org">Web2gether</a>, which is a site to help the special education community.

Currently all of the categories seen on the News Shaker site are manually sorted and loaded into the system after the spider crawls specific topics on the web. I am now working with LSA and SVMs to begin the text categorization of newly crawled websites and results. This project is also setting up a easy to use web managed content management system. This would allow for the quick set up and design of any topic based categorization using the methods developed while creating the original News Shaker which is focused on special education.
