I posted the [best articles I read while traveling](http://millermayersadventures.com/2015/01/24/best-articles-i-read-while-traveling/) and my [travel book list](http://millermayersadventures.com/2015/01/18/reading-while-traveling/) on our family blog. On my dev blog, I figured I could share my slightly nerdier posts.

I thought it might be fun to share some of my favorite's of the year. Many of these links come from [Doug Ramsay](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dougramsay), who sends a weekly engineering update along with the best links he has seen. Besides Doug's emails many links come from some of my awesome [LivingSocial colleagues](https://techblog.livingsocial.com/). Enjoy, and remember to [send to Kindle](http://www.amazon.com/gp/sendtokindle) to save your eyes.
