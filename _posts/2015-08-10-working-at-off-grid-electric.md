Some folks have asked about how I ended up at a job like [Off Grid Electric](https://medium.com/@Offgrid). I thought I would share a bit of that. I recently took a sabbatical to travel for about 5 months with my wife. While I was traveling, I was thinking about my career, the future, what is important to me. I felt like I hadn't been pushing myself enough lately, and I had lost some of the passion I always liked to bring into my work. 

### TL;DR

> "Across sub-Saharan Africa, fully 590 million people lack access to power. And it's a life-or-death issue: Indoor air pollution from wood stoves now kills 3.5 million people per year, more than AIDS and malaria combined." --[Brad Plumer: Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/07/02/a-closer-look-at-obamas-7-billion-plan-to-bring-electricity-to-africa/)

Stories illustrating the importance of our mission, and meeting our customers in Tanzania, helped restore a passion to my work. 

# Travel Shifts Perspectives

There is a great post by [how stuff works, call can travel change you?](http://adventure.howstuffworks.com/travel-change-you.htm) I would say it can change you if your open to it. I was thinking about my position in the world and looking to change things up. So I started getting interested in international positions, that could improve some of the major challenges in the world.

Seeing many different countries in my world definitely changed my thoughts on what were major challenges in the world:

* clean water
* sufficient sewage systems
* access to power
* clean energy
* functional mail systems
* trusted government / news 
* access to education
* income inequality

For awhile, I had been a bit stuck in an echo chamber of dev tools, consumer startups, and incremental improvements on social communications. While there is cool working going on there, I was a bit burnt out on it. I was only thinking about how I could work on my career to solve problems within those communities. When I looked outside of the communities I was involved in, I realized all the issues I found most important in the world to be outside of my current focuses. I wanted to help solve big problems, I knew I was passionate about. I wanted to avoid the often joked about tech quote that resonates a bit too loudly on occasion.

Although, there are some good [counterpoints, showing the legacy of amazing tools the industry is building](http://readwrite.com/2011/04/21/what-will-this-bubbles-legacy). Hilariously, I saw another version of this just today.

# Investing Your Time

There are great ways to support problems you care about, but in the end support often comes down to time or money. While I don't have lots of money to invest in these important issues, like [Bill Gates dedicating to invest $1 billion clean energy](http://www.gatesnotes.com/Energy/Energy-Innovation), I can invest my time, I can make working on these hard problems a part of my career path. A long career dedicated to working on big problems, seemed like a good way to help focus my direction for the future.

I started to think that many of the best engineers I know work at a cross section of engineering and knowing another domain extremely well. I decided I could look for work where I could leverage my software skills while learning more about a big issue I am passionate about improving. These thoughts were still forming in my head as we travel around.

Around that time I started to come across a post on my social media. I must have seen it three or four times before I decided it was something I needed to follow up on. I do know that [Micah](http://learntoduck.net/), whom I had know through [@techstars](http://www.techstars.com/) had posted the job to Facebook. His post was the final push to motivate me to finally click through and contact [@Off Grid Electric](https://twitter.com/offgride). The job post really seemed to be a great fit for what I was looking for, [a dream job for someone who loves adventure](https://medium.com/electric-africa/a-dream-job-for-someone-who-loves-adventure-d256b8d21a97).

# Know What You Want 

After a bit of time talking with [Thor Muller](https://twitter.com/tempo), it became clear that Off Grid Electric also satisfied other parts of a job I find important.

* We are a small highly distributed software team (US, Nigeria, Tanzania, Russia).
* We allow remote workers
* We are driven by a mission, which I find personally compelling
* Flexible and Travel friendly work
* I wanted to work on a project with international components
* While technology is important it is just one tool to solve problems
* A long term position - I want to invest time in a company and be able to grow with it.
* An opportunity to work closely with end users

The list really goes on, there was a lot to make everything seem right to me. It is good to take some time and reflect deeply on what you want, and what you want to be doing X years from now. Then find a path that can take you in that direction. I feel fortunate to have found that role.
