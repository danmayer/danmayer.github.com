This is a pretty cool project you can use via the update manager you just tell it the type of development you want to do (java swing/j2ee/java webapps/c++/ and others).
 
Anyways it is pretty good and gets a bunch of plugins together and manages them for you, so if newer versions of one thing still require an older version of another plug in it deals with any incompatibility issues.
 
You select what you want and then it will say you need other dependencies click the button that says get required.
 
That seems to be it.
