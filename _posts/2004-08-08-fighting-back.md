Well lately all the spam on my various websites had been getting out of control. They have machines that go to blogs and post comments with links to ads for words to raise their rating at google. It sucks it has been annoying me and the others that i host for. So i coded up a little thing i am hoping will help. We will see if it actually does. The good news is that i learned where code resides for the comments and i can add in more code and such if i need to to start blocking all the spammers. Fun huh. In the next couple days we will see if it works.    It is a good use of learning time since today i was reading learning perl and working on perl programming and the entire blogging system was written in perl. Yeaaa I am learn a language that people told me to learn better before applying to google.    if you have any problems leaving comments anywhere tell me with email...
